here schema is defined using SDL (Schema Defination Langauge)
The Schema Definition Language (SDL) is a syntax for defining GraphQL schemas that is human-readable and compact. 
It is a schema-first approach that defines types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions without specifying how the data is fetched or 
what business logic should be applied.

But but, JS envirnmonet cannot understand SDL, so they have to be converted into GraphQL Schema Objects.

The GraphQLSchema object is an internal representation of the schema that the GraphQL engine uses to execute queries. 
It includes all the information defined in the SDL schema, but in addition to that, it also attaches resolversâ€”the functions that 
actually fetch the data or perform actions when fields are queried.
The GraphQLSchema object ties these resolvers to the schema, so when a query is executed, the GraphQL engine knows which resolver to call for each field.

buildSchema -> (converts sdl to graphQL)
printSchema -> (converts graphql to sdl)

Running a GraphQL service:
1) GraphQL query Parsing
2) GraphQL query and schema validation
3) GraphQL query Execution

Abstract Syntax Trees(AST) are the core if graphQL
